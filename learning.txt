What I have learned from this course
Throughout this course, I’ve learned how powerful Git and GitHub are for managing and collaborating on code. I now understand how to track changes using commits, create and manage branches, and use pull requests to merge updates efficiently. 
I’ve also learned how to fork repositories and contribute to other projects, which has helped me appreciate the importance of version control in real-world software development. This knowledge has made me more confident in working on both personal and team-based projects.
